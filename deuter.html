            <h5 class="mb-4 pt-20">Deuter, one of the first artists on the Kuckuck label, has thirteen titles on
                Kuckuck, as
                well as the
                musical
                score of a
                picturepoem released on the MonteVideo label. They offer his unique uplifting melodies played on flute,
                guitar and
                synthesizer, blended with the sounds of nature. His creations incorporate a lightness of spirit, depth
                of
                vision, and a
                musical medley of East and West.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                Deuter himself is a product of both East and West. He was born in 1945, in a small village of post-war
                Germany. As a
                child, he learned flute and taught himself guitar and harmonica. As a young adult, he worked as a
                graphic designer and
                newspaper columnist in Munich, but the musical drive within him persisted. Eckart Rahn, a young record
                producer at that
                time, recognized Deuter’s talents, and in 1971 released Deuter’s first recording, D (11009-2), on the
                then fledgling
                Kuckuck label.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="mt-4">
                Deuter began to go into the mountains to record birds, water and wind to accompany his music. He was one
                of the first
                artists to do so and his deep relationship with nature persists to this day. He also began his spiritual
                search,
                spending much of his time at an ashram in Poona, India. Deuter was also one of the first artists to
                blend that Eastern
                influence into his music. He did that blending in such a gentle fashion that it never jarred Western
                ears, unaccustomed
                to Eastern rhythms and tonalities.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="my-4">
                Aum (11017-2) and Celebration (11040-2) were his first recordings to spring from this new direction in
                his life. His
                1978 release, Haleakala (11042-2), was recorded in Poona. This release was a true portrait of Deuter’s
                spiritual quest
                as well as production talents. Using a four-track tape machine and a progression of sub-mixes down to
                two tracks, Deuter
                was able to blend his own performances of two flutes, two guitars, organ synthesizer, and bells
                percussion along with
                natural sounds. This sixteen-track requirement he accomplished in the middle of India on just four
                tracks with an
                amazing technical fidelity.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                Future releases only perfected the recording quality of Deuter’s magical music. In his own words, that
                music takes us to
                the "beautiful place inside where the listener can experience warmth, the playfulness, the love, the
                compassion, the
                gentleness. That is the music I want to make for others." And that is just what he has done.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="my-4">
                Cicada (11056-2) and Nirvana Road (11068-2) showcase Deuter's remarkable ability to produce music that
                is "more and more
                danceful, lighter, happier and more playful, full of heart and still have in it somewhere a vision of
                silence." Call of
                the Unknown: Selected Pieces 1972-1986 (12076-2), contains a compilation of the most sublime pieces of
                Deuter's
                repertoire. Land of Enchantment (11081-2) is Deuter's biggest selling album.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                Together, these releases represent the first 21 years of Deuter's exceptional music, a spectrum of
                radiant outpourings
                and quiet meditations.
