            <h5 class="mb-4 pt-20">In all his endeavors, Steve Roach creates music that exists outside conventional
                boundaries. This composer, producer,
                synthesist and multi–instrumentalist is restless in his search for new sounds that connect with an
                ancient source of
                truth in this ever changing world.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                Roach has earned his position in the international pantheon of major new music artists over the last
                decade through his
                ceaseless productivity, constant innovation,and open–minded collaborations with numerous artists and the
                psychological
                depth of his music. Recognized worldwide as one of the leading innovators of contemporary electronic
                music, he has
                released numerous albums since 1981, including the double CD Dreamtime Return (18055-2), which received
                a perfect 10 out
                of 10 rating in CD Review magazine.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="mt-4">
                Roach’s music described by critic Dwight Loop, as "techno tribal music for the global village," blends
                the visceral
                sounds he designs on synthesizers and samplers with the primordial rhythms of ethnic percussion and
                other exotic
                instruments, including the Australian didgeridoo. He studied these traditional techniques and made his
                own instrument
                with Aboriginal didgeridoo master, David Hudson, during two extended trips to the continent. Roach also
                scored music for
                a PBS documentary on the rock art of the Dreamtime (the foundation of Aboriginal mythology) and recorded
                indigenous
                artists for the critically–acclaimed release Australia: Sound of the Earth (17071-2)
            </h5>
            <h5 class="my-4">
                Roach’s solo recording, Origins (17081-2), further blurs the lines between the ancestral and the
                futuristic in highly
                evocative ways. Through a powerful series of interlocking compositions, the sophistication of Roach’s
                electronic style
                artfully merges with his growing proficiency on percussion, voice, didgeridoo, and other ethnic
                instruments as he takes
                listeners back in time to the roots of musical expression. Origins also features several special guests,
                including
                Mexican percussionist, Jorge Reyes, and Spanish guitarist, Suso Saiz. Roach has been touring and
                recording with the two
                artists extensively over the last few years.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                A tireless producer and collaborator, Roach recently produced Woolunda: Tens Solos for Didgeridoo
                (13071-2), the first
                digital compact disc recording of solo didgeridoo music, featuring David Hudson. The summer of 1993 saw
                another
                production, featuring Native American flutist, Perry Silverbird. According to Down Beat, listening to
                Roach’s music is
                like following "a reliable musical muse into a dark, hypnotic realm that wafts of mysticism instead of
                marketing" but,
                then again, Roach has always followed his instincts rather than any preconceived notions of what would
                sell. His
                uncompromising approach has been rewarded with a steadily growing audience worldwide.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="my-4">
                The stark red–rock landscapes of Australia that inspired some of Roach’s finest work have much in common
                with the
                American Southwest, which has also influenced the composer’s music. While living in Los Angeles, the San
                Diego native
                released two groundbreaking albums inspired by the desert regions. The respected United Kingdom music
                magazine, Q,
                hailed Western Spaces (17051-2) as one of the "finest electronic albums of the decade" with a five-star
                rating.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                In 1989, Desert Solitaire (17070-2) paid homage to the Edward Abbey book by the same title, and
                inadvertently became a
                memorial to the author when Abbey died shortly after the music was recorded. According to JAZZIZ
                magazine, Desert
                Solitaire successfully tapped "into the melancholic, psychological depths of the desert, ‘the grandeur
                of the terrible,’
                as Abbey put it, with music that swirls and whispers." In 1990, Roach moved to the Sonoran desert just
                outside of
                Tucson, Arizona, to be closer to this powerful source of inspiration. There he released another
                monumental double CD,
                World's Edge (18057-2), which includes the hour–long epic To the Threshold of Silence, a subtle, slowly
                evolving
                composition that has been widely appreciated for its "keen understanding of the nuance of sound" (i/e).
            </h5>
            <h5 class="my-4">
                As one of the few electronic–based artists performing live consistently for over 10 years, Roach’s
                engagements have
                taken him from concert halls in the United States, Canada, and Europe to lava caves in the Canary
                Islands and volcanic
                craters in Mexico. These exotic settings have helped him further define his style, a sonic vision that
                thrives beyond
                categories, national boundaries, cultural barriers, and quite often, time itself.
